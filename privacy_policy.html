    <h1>Aira Breathe Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="meta">
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 8 January 2026</p>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 8 January 2026</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Aira Breathe ("Aira Breathe", "we", "us") is designed to help you complete guided breathing sessions without needing to create an account. This policy explains what information the app uses, where it's stored, and what choices you have.</p>
    
    <h2>1) Quick Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No account required.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No default server collection:</strong> By default, Aira Breathe does not collect or transmit your personal data to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>On-device storage:</strong> Your breathing sessions, preferences, and history are stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>No selling:</strong> We do not sell your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Apple integrations:</strong> If you enable Apple features (e.g., Apple Health/HealthKit or Apple Music), they are handled through Apple system frameworks and subject to Apple's policies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>2) Who This Policy Applies To</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Aira Breathe iOS app (and any companion watch app, if provided), and</li>
        <li>Related support pages that link to this policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you use Aira Breathe through Apple platforms (App Store, Apple Music, Health app), Apple may collect or process certain information under Apple's privacy policies. We recommend reviewing Apple's policies as well.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>3) Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Data we collect and send to our servers (default)</h3>
    <p><strong>None by default.</strong><br>
    Aira Breathe is designed so that your session data and preferences remain on your device, and we do not operate a user account system for the app.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Data processed when you enable optional Apple integrations</h3>
    <p>If you turn on optional features, the app may process information using Apple-provided frameworks:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Apple Health / HealthKit (optional)</strong><br>
    If you grant permission, Aira Breathe may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read heart rate in-memory during a session to adapt session cadence.</li>
        <li>Not store or transmit heart rate data (the reading is used transiently in the moment).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you enable Apple Watch live heart rate streaming, the Watch app may start a workout session so heart rate can be read continuously. If permitted by you, this may cause a workout record to be saved to Apple Health.</p>
    <p>You can change Health permissions at any time:<br>
    <strong>Settings → Health → Aira Breathe</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Apple Music playback (optional)</strong><br>
    If you use Apple Music features in the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playback and related data are handled by Apple's media frameworks.</li>
        <li>We do not receive your Apple Music listening history from Apple unless Apple explicitly provides it via granted permissions (and Aira Breathe is designed not to upload it to our servers).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>4) Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>Aira Breathe may store the following locally on your device:</p>
    
    <h3>4.1 Preferences</h3>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Appearance/theme choices</li>
        <li>Sound settings</li>
        <li>Haptics settings</li>
        <li>Reminder settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.2 Session history and insights</h3>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Session timestamps, duration, technique used</li>
        <li>On-device insights derived from your sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sensitive fields (for example, session notes and mood) are encrypted on-device.</p>
    
    <h3>4.3 Health-related settings (not Health data)</h3>
    <p>If you enable HealthKit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app may store your authorization status and feature settings (e.g., whether adaptive pacing is enabled).</li>
        <li>Heart rate readings (if used) are handled in-memory during a session and are not stored or transmitted by Aira Breathe.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.4 Diagnostics summaries (on-device)</h3>
    <p>The app may store basic diagnostics summaries locally, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local crash or hang metrics provided by iOS (e.g., via MetricKit)</li>
        <li>Performance summaries that help you (or support) understand stability issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These diagnostics are intended for troubleshooting on your device unless you choose to share them with us.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>5) Data Sharing</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 We do not sell data</h3>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>5.2 We do not share session data by default</h3>
    <p>Because Aira Breathe does not upload your session history to our servers by default, we do not share that data with third parties in the ordinary course of app use.</p>
    
    <h3>5.3 Sharing you control</h3>
    <p>You may choose to share information in limited cases, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you contact support and decide to send screenshots, logs, or diagnostic exports</li>
        <li>If you enable Apple Health/HealthKit and Apple records data in the Health app based on your permissions and Apple's system behavior</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>6) Permissions and How the App Uses Them</h2>
    <p>Depending on what you enable, the app may request permissions. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HealthKit (optional):</strong> to read heart rate for adaptive pacing, and potentially to support Apple Watch continuous heart rate (workout session).</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications/Reminders (optional):</strong> to deliver breathing reminders (if you turn reminders on).</li>
        <li><strong>Music/Media (optional):</strong> for Apple Music playback controls (if you enable music features).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can always manage permissions in iOS Settings.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>7) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because most data is stored on-device, retention is generally controlled by you and your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preferences and session history remain until you delete them or remove the app.</li>
        <li>If your device is backed up (e.g., iCloud or Finder), some app data may be included in backups depending on iOS backup behavior and your settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>8) Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your data in these ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear in-app history:</strong> You can clear local session history from within the app's Settings (where available).</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Removing the app typically removes locally stored data from that device, subject to iOS behavior (for example, restoration from backups).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have shared information with us through support (e.g., an email attachment), you can request deletion of that support correspondence, subject to legal/operational requirements.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>9) Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable safeguards designed for an on-device-first app, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On-device encryption for sensitive fields (e.g., notes/mood)</li>
        <li>Minimizing collection and transmission by default</li>
        <li>Using Apple system security features for permissions and protected data access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of storage is 100% secure, but we design Aira Breathe to minimize exposure by keeping data local whenever possible.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>10) Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Aira Breathe is not intended for use by children where parental consent is required by law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us (for example, via a support email), contact us and we will take appropriate steps.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>11) Your Rights (UK/EU and Other Regions)</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Deletion of personal data you have provided to us</li>
        <li>Objection or restriction of certain processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because Aira Breathe does not collect data to our servers by default, these rights will most commonly be exercised by managing or deleting data on your device. If you have contacted support and shared information with us, you can request access or deletion of that correspondence by contacting us.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Material changes may also be communicated in-app.</p>
    
    <div class="divider">⸻</div>
    
    <h2>13) Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about privacy:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> [add your support email here]<br>
    <strong>Support page:</strong> [add your support URL here]</p>
    <p>If you prefer, you can also refer to the Privacy Policy available inside the app's Settings.</p>
